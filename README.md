## About MdDoc 

_MdDoc_ is a web-based application for creating, editing, and organizing documents in Markdown or plain text. Each document can include a title, description, tags, and an optional file attachment. The system tracks a full revision history: every change is saved, and archived documents additionally support versioning.

Users can restore earlier revisions or versions at any time. Deletion is non-destructive â€“ documents are simply marked as deleted and remain available for searching and review. An integrated cleanup tool allows selective removal of deleted documents, outdated revisions, and archived content.

_MdDoc_ was created out of a personal need to better organize notes, guides, and written material accumulated over time. It helps prevent accidental data loss by preserving older document states and offers a lightweight, flexible way to manage all kinds of text-based information. While designed for general use, it is especially well suited for users who value structure, traceability, and simplicity in document management.
